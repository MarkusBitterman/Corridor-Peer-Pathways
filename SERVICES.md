## 🧭 About Corridor Peer Pathways

**Corridor Peer Pathways** is an independent peer support practice serving the I-380 Corridor in Eastern Iowa (Iowa City, Coralville, North Liberty, Cedar Rapids, Marion, and surrounding communities).

This practice is offered **independently** as an **independent contractor** and is **not affiliated with Shelter House Iowa** or any other organization, though I am a proud graduate and advocate of the Fairweather Lodge program.

## 🚫 What Peer Support Is NOT

To protect both peers and participants, it's important to be clear about boundaries:

**Peer support does NOT provide:**
- Clinical therapy or counseling (requires licensed professional)
- Diagnosis or medical advice (see a doctor)
- Legal services (consult an attorney)
- Emergency or crisis response (call 911 or 988)
- Case management (offered by agencies)
- Housing placement (work with housing agencies)
- Financial assistance (see community resources)

**If you need any of the above services, please see the [Community Resources Directory](resources/) for appropriate contacts.**

## 💰 Scheduling & Rates

**Contact:** bittermang@duck.com

Rates are discussed on a case-by-case basis, with sliding scale options available based on need. The goal is to make peer support accessible, not to create barriers.

For scheduling inquiries, service questions, or to discuss how peer support might fit your recovery journey, please reach out via email.

## 🌱 Philosophy

> **This is Eastern Iowa.  
> This is mental health & crisis recovery.  
> This is peer support, lived honestly and shared freely.**

Recovery was never meant to be proprietary. At many points in my life, I was "fit" to disappear quietly. Instead, I found a path—one that **didn't cut me when I stepped onto it**.

This practice exists so that path doesn't vanish behind me.

**Recovery sticks when it has texture.**

That means doing things together:
- Walking the bus routes
- Cleaning a room
- Rolling dice at a table
- Moving your body
- Sitting with discomfort
- Building trust—one ride, one day, one choice at a time
