# Corridor Peer Pathways
### An open, living map for Mental Health & Crisis Recovery Peer Support in Eastern Iowa

---

## 🧭 Welcome

**Corridor Peer Pathways** is an open-source, community-maintained peer support resource and practice framework for the I-380 Corridor in Eastern Iowa:

**Iowa City • Coralville • North Liberty • Tiffin • Solon • Cedar Rapids • Hiawatha • Marion • and the greater metro corridor between them**

This project exists to say—quickly and clearly:

> **This is Eastern Iowa.  
> This is mental health & crisis recovery.  
> This is peer support, lived honestly and shared freely.**

We are not building a platform to own recovery.  
We are building **pathways** so people can find their own.

## 🧠 Philosophy

This is a public-good repository containing:
- A **peer support philosophy** grounded in lived experience
- Clear explanations of **what peer support is (and is not)**
- A **local-first resource directory** for Johnson & Linn Counties
- Practical, human **recovery skill-building activities**
- Templates, language, and structures that anyone can reuse, remix, or fork

This is not a startup pitch.  
This is not a walled garden.  
This is a **map left out in the open**.

## 🔑 Core Principles

### Peer Support, Explained Plainly
- Grounded in **lived experience**
- Built on **trust, dignity, and mutual respect**
- Clear about what peer support does (and doesn't do)

### Scope of Role (Trust is Infrastructure)
**What peer support does:**
- Goal-setting and accountability
- Skill-building and confidence-building
- Resource navigation (local, real, current)
- Community reintegration
- Walking alongside—not directing from above

**What it does not do:**
- Clinical therapy
- Diagnosis or medical advice
- Legal services
- Emergency or crisis response

This clarity protects peers *and* participants.

### Local Resources (Johnson & Linn Counties)
No shame. No jargon. No maze without a legend.

### Recovery as Practice (Not Just Talk)
Recovery sticks when it has texture:
- Mindfulness, medication consistency, journaling
- Movement and walking the Corridor cities
- Learning to trust the bus—one ride at a time
- Building confidence through doing

---

## 🌱 Why Open Source?

Because recovery was never meant to be proprietary.

At many points in my life, I was "fit" to disappear quietly.  
Instead, I found a path—one that **didn't cut me when I stepped onto it**.

This repo exists so that path doesn't vanish behind me.

**Fork it. Adapt it. Localize it. Print it. Teach from it. Build something kinder with it.**
