# Golden Nuggets 🪛✨

## 🧭 Field-Tested Peer Support Lessons from Real-World Moments

This directory contains **Golden Nuggets**: practical peer support frameworks derived from everyday experiences in recovery and daily life. Each nugget takes a real moment—often humorous or frustrating—and extracts a reusable model for emotional regulation, problem-solving, and forward momentum.

**These are distinct from the [Community Resources](../resources/) section**, which provides contact information for local services. Nuggets focus on **repeatable peer support methods**, not directories.

## 📚 Current Golden Nuggets

### 🪛 [The Incredible Vanishing Screwdriver](the-incredible-missing-screwdriver.md)
**A framework for emotional regulation and Plan B thinking when things don't go as expected**

A humorous real-life moment—losing a screwdriver mid-task—teaches a reusable peer support model for emotional regulation and problem-solving.

**The 6-step framework:**
1. **Anchor** – Pause and notice the emotional reaction before it takes over
2. **Rewind** – Retrace your steps methodically instead of frantically searching
3. **Radius** – Expand the search area systematically (nearby → adjacent → unlikely)
4. **Light** – Use tools to help you see better (flashlight, fresh perspective, ask for help)
5. **Break / Plan B** – Accept the current state and pivot to alternatives
6. **System** – Turn the experience into a lesson for next time

**Core lesson:** Maintaining agency, gentleness, and forward momentum even when things don't immediately resolve.

**Applies to:** Lost objects, forgotten tasks, moments when you "lost your cool," relationship conflicts, mental health crises

### 🚌 [Emotional Regulation & Driving a Bus](emotional-regulation-and-driving-a-bus.md)
**Understanding emotions as passengers, not drivers, on your life's journey**

Uses the metaphor of emotions as bus passengers to explain regulation. You are the driver—emotions provide information but don't provide directions.

**Key insights:**
- Why negative emotions feel more "real" than positive ones (miscalibration, not pessimism)
- What regulation actually is: staying in the driver's seat, not suppressing feelings
- When emotions get stuck (trauma, unfinished experiences, learned survival responses)
- When emotions try to drive (dysregulation: panic grabs the wheel, anger slams the accelerator)

**Core lesson:** You are not your emotions. You are responsible for their safe transport. Feelings provide information, not directions.

### 🌙 [Developing Great Bedtime Rituals; Keeping Them Wherever You Sleep](developing-great-bedtime-rituals.md)
**Building portable self-care routines that work anywhere you sleep**

Comprehensive guide to building portable bedtime rituals that work in any sleeping environment—your home, hotels, shelters, or when unhoused.

**The 3-part ritual framework:**
1. **Wind-Down** (15-30 min) – Signal that the active day is ending
2. **Hygiene Routine** (10-15 min) – Brush teeth, wash face, shower/rinse key areas
3. **Settle & Sleep** (5-10 min) – Final anchor before sleep

**Includes:**
- Portable essentials for unfamiliar places (toothbrush, soap, clean socks, earplugs, eye mask)
- Adaptations when resources are limited
- Health benefits of sleep, bathing, and oral care (with specific science)
- Cross-references to [local resources](../resources/) for hygiene products (Shelter House, HACAP, Waypoint, food banks, crisis services)

**Core lesson:** The ritual is the anchor, not the location. You can carry your sense of safety with you.
