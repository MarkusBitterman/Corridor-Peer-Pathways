# Know Your Rights: ICE & Immigration Enforcement

## ✊ You Have Rights

**Regardless of your immigration status, you have constitutional rights in the United States.**

This section exists because fear thrives in silence.  
Knowledge reduces harm.

This is **not legal advice**.  
This is **not a guide to evasion**.  
This is a **rights-literacy primer** designed to counter intimidation and misinformation.

## 🏠 If ICE Comes to Your Home

### Know This First
- **ICE cannot enter your home without your consent OR a valid judicial warrant signed by a judge.**
- An **administrative warrant (Form I-200 or I-205)** is NOT enough to enter without consent.
- A **judicial warrant** will have a judge's signature and be issued by a court.

### What to Do
1. **Do not open the door.** You can speak through the door or a window.
2. **Ask:** "Do you have a warrant signed by a judge?"
3. **If they say yes:** Ask them to slide it under the door or hold it to a window. Look for a judge's signature.
4. **If they do not have a judicial warrant:** You can say, **"I do not consent to your entry."**
5. **Stay calm.** Do not lie, but remember you have the right to remain silent.

### Important
- ICE may claim they have a warrant when they do not. Ask to see it.
- Do not sign anything without speaking to an attorney.
- If agents enter without consent or a valid warrant, stay calm, do not resist, and note what happened for your attorney.
