# Corridor Peer Pathways 
## Introduction

This repository, **Corridor Peer Pathways**, serves as a community-driven resource for mental health and crisis recovery support. It empowers the Eastern Iowa community with peer support philosophy, detailed local resource directories, and practical recovery skill-building. These resources aim to help people find their own unique paths, not dictate them.

> **“This is Eastern Iowa. This is mental health & crisis recovery. This is peer support, lived honestly and shared freely.”**

We are committed to building a living map of resources that is honest, accessible, and beneficial for all.

## 🧭 Welcome

**Corridor Peer Pathways** is an open-source, community-maintained peer support resource and practice framework for the I-380 Corridor in Eastern Iowa:

**Iowa City • Coralville • North Liberty • Tiffin • Solon • Cedar Rapids • Hiawatha • Marion • and the greater metro corridor between them**

This project exists to say—quickly and clearly:

> **This is Eastern Iowa.  
> This is mental health & crisis recovery.  
> This is peer support, lived honestly and shared freely.**

We are not building a platform to own recovery.  
We are building **pathways** so people can find their own.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

This is a public-good repository containing:
- A **peer support philosophy** grounded in lived experience
- Clear explanations of **what peer support is (and is not)**
- A **local-first resource directory** for Johnson & Linn Counties
- Practical, human **recovery skill-building activities**
- Templates, language, and structures that anyone can reuse, remix, or fork

This is not a startup pitch.  
This is not a walled garden.  
This is a **map left out in the open**.

---

## 🔑 Core Principles

### Peer Support, Explained Plainly
- Grounded in **lived experience**
- Built on **trust, dignity, and mutual respect**
- Clear about what peer support does (and doesn't do)

### Scope of Role (Trust is Infrastructure)
**What peer support does:**
- Goal-setting and accountability
- Skill-building and confidence-building
- Resource navigation (local, real, current)
- Community reintegration
- Walking alongside—not directing from above

**What it does not do:**
- Clinical therapy
- Diagnosis or medical advice
- Legal services
- Emergency or crisis response

This clarity protects peers *and* participants.

### Local Resources (Johnson & Linn Counties)
No shame. No jargon. No maze without a legend.

### Recovery as Practice (Not Just Talk)
Recovery sticks when it has texture:
- Mindfulness, medication consistency, journaling
- Movement and walking the Corridor cities
- Learning to trust the bus—one ride at a time
- Building confidence through doing

---

## 🌱 Why Open Source?

Because recovery was never meant to be proprietary.

At many points in my life, I was "fit" to disappear quietly.  
Instead, I found a path—one that **didn't cut me when I stepped onto it**.

This repo exists so that path doesn't vanish behind me.

**Fork it. Adapt it. Localize it. Print it. Teach from it. Build something kinder with it.**

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

### Independence & Transparency
I am a graduate and advocate of **Shelter House Iowa** and their **Fairweather Lodge** program. I currently work at Shelter House Iowa as **Senior Fresh Starts Janitor and Peer Support** at the 501 Southgate building.

**Corridor Peer Pathways** is offered **independently** as an **independent contractor** practice, separate from my employment at Shelter House Iowa.

That distinction is explicit, respectful, and intentional.

### **Corridor Peer Pathways Support Services**

This repository and the peer support services offered by **Matthew Hall** (bittermang@duck.com) as an independent peer support specialist.

#### **This Repository**
Community-maintained peer support resources for the I-380 Corridor in Eastern Iowa.

#### **[Golden Nuggets](nuggets/)** 🪛
**Field-tested peer support lessons from real-world moments**

Nuggets are short, practical peer support frameworks derived from everyday experiences in recovery and daily life. Each "Golden Nugget" takes a real moment—often humorous or frustrating—and extracts a reusable model for emotional regulation, problem-solving, and forward momentum.

**Current Nuggets:**
- [The Incredible Vanishing Screwdriver](nuggets/the-incredible-missing-screwdriver.md) – A framework for emotional regulation and Plan B thinking when things don't go as expected
- [Emotional Regulation & Driving a Bus](nuggets/emotional-regulation-and-driving-a-bus.md) – Understanding emotions as passengers, not drivers, on your life's journey
- [Developing Great Bedtime Rituals](nuggets/developing-great-bedtime-rituals.md) – Building portable self-care routines that work anywhere you sleep

These Golden Nuggets draw from lived experience to help us live with mindfulness and greater understanding. They are distinct from the community resources above—Nuggets focus on **repeatable peer support methods**, not contact information.

**We welcome your contributions.** If you have lived experiences that could help others navigate their own journeys, we invite you to share them with this repository. Your story might become the next Golden Nugget that helps someone find their way.
