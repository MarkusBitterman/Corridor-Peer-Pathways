## 🤝 Peer Support Philosophy

> **You are a person.  
> Your experiences are valid.  
> You belong here.**

Peer support for refugees and new Americans means:
- **Meeting you where you are**—not where systems expect you to be
- **Respecting** that you are the expert on your own life
- **Acknowledging** that building a life in a new country is hard work
- **Walking alongside**—not directing from above

Recovery does not require fluency in English or in American systems.  
It requires **connection, safety, and someone who sees you**.
